# Test item

## What this is

This is a *concise* item to test <em>various</em> features on the production environment.  
With its name, this item can be quickly used to verify if it's still (more or less) at the beginning of the Browse list when items are ordered alphabetically.  
Its manifest file contains several options like external documentation url, owner, vendor etc. Just check the sidebar.

## Styles

It also has this description file containing a lot of different formatting styles.  
It can be used to test several styles of *[markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code-blocks)* like line breaks. \
In this way, you can verify how the Catalog app from [Skyline's cloud services][1] complies with markdown rules.

| A table | with three | header columns |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| and two rows with text | the first row has more content | the cells of the last row will contain less text |
| aligned *left* | in the **center** | and _right_ |

### Code

```
some code
that is formatted
with triple backticks at the beginning and the end
```

    another code block
    that is formatted
    with four spaces before every line

And even some `inline code` by using single backticks.

### More formatting styles

> A quote by - some famous author

1. with **bold**, *italic* 
1. and <ins>underlined</ins> text
